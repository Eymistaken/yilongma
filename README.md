✨ Features
Classic Clicker Action: Click the 🚽 to farm Gyatt Points.

Upgrade System: Spend your points on "More Rizz" to increase your points-per-click (PPC).

Dynamic Markets: Buy and sell 9 different assets, from the Turkish Lira (TL) to Bitcoin (BTC) and even Diamonds (DIA). Watch prices change in real-time with Chart.js.

AI Opponent (Yilong Ma): Compete directly against Yilong Ma! He has his own starting wealth and investment strategy based on the difficulty.

Live "Skitter" Feed: Watch for market-moving "skitts" from Yilong Ma and "Skitter Analysis." Yilong's purchases can pump an asset's price!

Multiple Difficulty Modes: Choose from 5 difficulties, from "Peaceful" (no tax, friendly Yilong) to "Hardcore" (brutal taxes, aggressive Yilong).

Tax System: Beware the tax man! Random taxes will hit both you and Yilong, potentially forcing asset liquidation.
